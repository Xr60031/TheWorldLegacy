                "Spirit Weaver Exorcists are unique beings, embodying values of healing, mending, and peace. Their primary mission is to assist spirits in finding tranquility within the spirit realm. Despite their pacifistic nature, they are not to be underestimated. When their sacred duty is threatened, they unleash a formidable power against their foes, revealing a side that belies their peaceful facade.",
                "As a Spirit Weaver transcends to the afterlife, they leave behind subtle hints, guiding their successors on their path. Even in death, they continue to serve, providing ethereal counsel from the other side. Their life is a testament to their unwavering devotion to the spiritual realm, and even in rest, they remain a beacon for those who follow in their footsteps. This is the paradoxical existence of a Spirit Weaver - a peaceful warrior, a silent guide, and an eternal servant of the spirit realm.",
